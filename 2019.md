- Started work on strmname package to parse stream names
  - [problem] Stream Names could be its own type in Go to be more idiomatic.
    Lack in understanding why it wasn't done in Ruby makes the decision
    more difficult
  - [problem] Eventide uses a lot of nested packages (e.g. NoStream,
    ExpectedVersion), which is not idiomatic in Go. What would be the
    correct idiomatic way to do this in Go?
